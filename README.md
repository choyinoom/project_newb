# itHub

**itHub** is a Spring Boot Java web application. Its frontend layouts are very similar to GitHub's. I focused on the version controlling feature, so you can find the approximate logic about the way git creates git objects from [here](./src/main/java/com/project/myApplication/util/).

My primary goals were:  
- Build an application with Spring Boot
- Handle HTTP multi-part file uploads
- Process files Using file I/O methods
